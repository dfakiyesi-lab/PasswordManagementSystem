# üîê Password Management System in AWS (Passbolt)

## üéØ Objective
To securely host and manage complex passwords in the cloud using **Passbolt**, leveraging **AWS infrastructure** for scalability, security, and accessibility.

---

## üß∞ Tools & Technologies Used
- **Passbolt** (self-hosted password manager)
- **AWS EC2** (virtual server hosting)
- **AWS Route 53** (domain hosting and DNS management)
- **Nginx** (web server)
- **Let‚Äôs Encrypt / Certbot** (SSL certificate setup)
- **HTTPS Encryption**

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Steps Performed

1. **Provisioned an EC2 Instance**
   - Launched an Ubuntu-based EC2 instance on AWS.
   - Configured inbound security groups for HTTP (80), HTTPS (443), and SSH (22).

2. **Installed and Configured Passbolt**
   - Deployed **Passbolt CE (Community Edition)** on the EC2 instance.
   - Configured the database, PHP, and Nginx dependencies.
   - Verified successful installation and access through the server‚Äôs public IP.

3. **Secured with HTTPS**
   - Installed **Certbot** to enable **SSL encryption** for the Passbolt domain.
   - Enforced HTTPS redirection in Nginx configuration.

4. **Configured Domain and DNS**
   - Purchased or configured a domain name via **AWS Route 53**.
   - Linked the EC2 instance‚Äôs public IP to the domain‚Äôs A record.
   - Ensured accessibility via the domain (e.g., `https://passwordvault.example.com`).

5. **Implemented Password Management Features**
   - Configured user accounts and groups within Passbolt.
   - Demonstrated secure creation, storage, and sharing of complex passwords.
   - Verified encryption during transmission and storage.

6. **Maintenance and Monitoring**
   - Set up instance monitoring through AWS CloudWatch.
   - Regularly updated the Passbolt instance and SSL certificates for continued security.

## üîí Security Highlights

- Enforced HTTPS encryption for secure communication.
- Hosted Passbolt in a controlled AWS environment with strict security group rules.
- Used **self-hosted** architecture to eliminate third-party password storage risks.
- Enhanced data protection and operational availability via AWS services.
